The ```int``` type is a blueprint for the information required to define a whole number, but the variable ```a``` in the code segment above is an object of the ```int``` type with data which represents the value 2.\n","\n","An object of a certain type is sometimes referred to as an \"instance\" of the that type.\n","\n","It is worth noting that the word \"class\" is almost interchangable with the word \"type\" in modern Python, although their meanings differed more in earlier versions of the language."]}]}
